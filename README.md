# Algorithms

Simple functions and algorithms to learn and practice with elixir's syntax and patterns.

## Test Functions

With elixir installed, you can run algorithms listed in the `lib/algorithms.exs` file by running:

```
iex -S mix
```

Which will launch an interactive shell.

The Algorithm module named `Ag` will automatically be loaded into the global namespace. You can then call functions defined in it:

```
iex(1)> Ag.fizz_buzz_1
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11

14
FizzBuzz
:ok
```
